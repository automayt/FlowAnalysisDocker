# FlowAnalysisDocker
A Dockerfile for creation of an Ubuntu Docker with SiLK/YAF/FlowBAT for testing.

## Summary
The goal of this Dockerfile is to allow you to easily set up a controlled test environment for testing SiLK and [FlowBAT](http://www.flowbat.com/). I still recommend setting up an ubuntu virtual machine for testing if possible and following the instructions at http://www.flowbat.com/installation.html.

## ToDo
This is a first commit with only a basic dockerfile that will install SiLK and YAF. FlowBAT still needs to be installed. It also needs service controls.
